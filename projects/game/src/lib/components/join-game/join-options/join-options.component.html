    <p>
      Dark McCooey Hex Chess is a variant of McCooey Hex Chess. All the pieces move in the same fashion. The differences are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A player is only able to see squares that their pieces are capable of moving to or attacking, hence the name
        Dark Chess.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no concept of 'check'. Because of the above limitation, a king may mot be able to see all of it's
        attackers. A player may make a move that results in their king being taken on the opponent's next move.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no concept of 'stalemate' because there is no check.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no concept of 'checkmate' because there is no check.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since there is no concept of 'check' or 'checkmate', the object of the game is to capture the opponent's king.
      </li>
    </ul>
