  <p>
    The players take turns moving pieces as described below. The following conditions must be met for a legal move:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The player's king may not be in 'Check' at the end of the move.</li>
    <li>The player must move a piece as described below.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If either condition can not be met, the game is over. If the player's king is in '<a href="#Check">Check</a>' it
    is termed 'Checkmate' and the player loses. If the player's king is not in '<a href="#Check">Check</a>', it is
    termed a 'Statemate' and the game is a tie.</p>
  <h5><a name="Check">Check</a></h5>
  <p>A king is in 'Check' if the hex it occupies is attacked by an opposing piece as described below.</p>
  <h5><a name="Taking">Taking</a></h5>

    <b><a name="Pieces.Pawns">Pawns</a></b> move directly forward one space if the space is not occupied. Pawns
    can only attack one space diagonaly forward to either side, they cannot attack directly forward.

  <p><a name="Pieces.Pawns.En Passant"><i>Two-space move and 'en passant':</i></a> If a pawn has not made a previous
    move in the game, it may move forward two spaces if both spaces are not occupied. If the intermediate space is
    attacked by an opposing pawn, the opponent has the option of 'taking' the pawn on the next move as if it had only
    been moved one space. This right is called 'en passant' ('take in passing') and must be exercised immediately or
    forfeited.

  <p><a name="Pieces.Pawns.Promoting"><i>Promoting:</i></a> When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting
    position it must be exchanged as part of the same move on the same hex for a new <a href="#Pieces.Queens">queen</a>,
    <a href="#Pieces.Rooks">rook</a>, <a href="#Pieces.Bishops">bishop</a>, or <a href="#Pieces.Knights">knight</a> of
    the same colour. The player’s choice is not restricted to pieces that have been captured previously. This exchange
    of a pawn for another piece is called ‘promotion’ and the effect of the new piece is immediate.

  <p>
    Dark McCooey Hex Chess is a variant of McCooey Hex Chess. All the pieces move in the same fashion. The differences
    are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A player is only able to see hexes that their pieces are capable of moving to or attacking, hence the name
      Dark McCooey Hex Chess.</li>
    <li>There is no concept of 'check'. Because of the above limitation, a king may mot be able to see all of it's
      attackers. A player may make a move that results in their king being taken on the opponent's next move.</li>
    <li>There is no concept of 'stalemate' because there is no check.</li>
    <li>There is no concept of 'checkmate' because there is no check.</li>
    <li>Since there is no concept of 'check' or 'checkmate', the object of the game is to capture the opponent's
      king.</li>
